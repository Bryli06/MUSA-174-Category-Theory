\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category, and $f : x \to y$ be a morphism. Show that if $f$ is an isomorphism, its inverse is unique. 
    \begin{soln}
        AFSOC, $g \ne g',$ and both $g$ and $g'$ are inverses of $f.$ Then, 
        \begin{equation}
            g = g1_y = g(fg') = (gf)g' = 1_x g' = g'
        \end{equation} Therefore, $g=g'$ so the inverse is unique.
    \end{soln}
    \item Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category, and $f : x \to y$ be a morphism. Suppose we have morphisms $g, h : y \to x$ such that $gf = 1_x$ and $fh = 1_y$. Show that 
$g = h$ and conclude that $f$ is an isomorphism. 
    \begin{soln}
        \begin{equation}
            g = g 1_y = g(fh) = (gf) h = 1_x h = h
        \end{equation} 
        Therefore, by definition, $f$ is an isomorphism.
    \end{soln}
\end{enumerate}
